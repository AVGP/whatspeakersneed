## What speakers need

Collected from experienced speakers to help conference organisers make things better

### Can speakers use their own laptop?

*Many speakers prefer to use their own kit because it is set up in the way they like*

- What projector connectors will the conference provide? (HDMI, VGA)
- What power cables will the conference provide?

### Will they need to use a microphone?**

*this might affect what people can wear*

If so

- is it handheld, they may need some guidance on how to hold it
- is it a lapel mic and battery pack, they will need a belt or a pocket for the pack
- something else?

### Are you filming the talks

- is there a release form?
- does it have details of what will be done with the footage?

### What format can the slides be in?

- will they be restricted by the projectors?
- will there be a screen and what will they see on it? (some speakers want to see the next slide and their notes)
