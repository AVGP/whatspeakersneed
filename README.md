## What speakers need

Collected from experienced speakers to help conference organisers make things better

**Can speakers use their own laptop?
Many speakers prefer to use their own kit because it is set up for them

Let speakers know if there is a microphone (this may affect what the speakers wear).
If so
- is it handheld, they may need some guidance on how to hold it
- is it a lapel mic and battery pack, they will need a belt or a pocket for the pack
- something else?

Are you filming them?

- is there a release form?
- does it have details of what will be done with the footage?

What format can the slides be in? 

What projector connectors will the conference provide?

What power cables will the conference provide?

Is it on a stage?

What layout is the room?
